description: Start PaperSpine — research, then rewrite or build a paper or report end to end
argument-hint: "[optional: target/scene, e.g. 'IEEE conference paper from ./materials']"
---

Start the PaperSpine workflow for the current project using the **`$paper-spine`
orchestrator** skill. Route through `$paper-spine`; do not call the worker
sub-skills directly unless the orchestrator tells you to.

If `paper_rewriting_output/paper_spine_config.json` is missing or incomplete,
launch the PaperSpine intake UI automatically (do not hand-write the config).
Resolve the launcher by its absolute installed path — Codex runs from the
project folder, where `scripts/` does not exist.

### Windows

```powershell
$config = Join-Path (Get-Location) "paper_rewriting_output\paper_spine_config.json"
$launcher = @(
  "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\paper-spine-intake\scripts\launch_paperspine_ui.ps1",
  "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\paper-spine-ui\scripts\launch_paperspine_ui.ps1",
  "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\paper-spine-intake\scripts\launch_paperspine_ui.ps1"
) | Where-Object { Test-Path $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
if (-not $launcher) { throw "PaperSpine UI launcher not found. Reinstall or resync PaperSpine." }
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config)) {
  powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $launcher -OutputDir "paper_rewriting_output"
}
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 120 -and -not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config); $i++) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 5 }
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $config)) {
  throw "PaperSpine intake config not created yet. Finish the opened UI window, then rerun /paperspine."
}
Get-Content -LiteralPath $config -Raw
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
CONFIG="paper_rewriting_output/paper_spine_config.json"
LAUNCHER="$HOME/.codex/skills/paper-spine-intake/scripts/launch_paperspine_ui.sh"
[ -f "$LAUNCHER" ] || LAUNCHER="$HOME/.codex/skills/paper-spine-ui/scripts/launch_paperspine_ui.sh"
[ -f "$LAUNCHER" ] || LAUNCHER="$HOME/.claude/skills/paper-spine-intake/scripts/launch_paperspine_ui.sh"
if [ ! -f "$LAUNCHER" ]; then
  echo "PaperSpine UI launcher not found. Reinstall or resync PaperSpine." >&2; exit 1
fi
if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ]; then
  chmod +x "$LAUNCHER"; bash "$LAUNCHER" "paper_rewriting_output"
fi
for i in $(seq 1 120); do [ -f "$CONFIG" ] && break; sleep 5; done
if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ]; then
  echo "PaperSpine intake config not created yet. Finish the opened terminal, then rerun /paperspine." >&2; exit 1
fi
cat "$CONFIG"
```

### After config is ready

When the config already exists, read it and continue through the `$paper-spine`
orchestrator workflow (research → confirm motivation → rationale matrix →
rewrite/build → LaTeX/PDF/Word → audit) without relaunching intake unless
required fields are missing. If `$1` was provided, treat it as the target/scene hint.
