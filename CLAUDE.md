# PaperSpine Project Memory

## Project Purpose

PaperSpine is a motivation-driven paper and report writing skill suite (12 skills)
for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw.  The workflow researches the target scene,
confirms the controlling motivation with the user, builds a writing rationale
matrix, then writes/rewrites with LaTeX/PDF output.

## Repository Shape

- `dist/claude/skills/*`: Claude Code flat skill suite (12 skills)
- `dist/claude/commands/*.md`: Claude Code slash command (`paperspine.md`, single entry point)
- `dist/codex/skills/*`: Codex flat skill suite
- `dist/codex/paper-spine`: legacy Codex bundled fallback
- `dist/codex/prompts/*.md`: Codex custom prompts (`/paperspine` slash command)
- `dist/openclaw/skills/*`: OpenClaw flat skill suite
- `src/scripts/*`: shared deterministic scripts (standard library only)
- `src/references/*`: shared workflow reference docs (single source; includes `interactive-intake.md`)
- `.claude-plugin/*`: Claude Code plugin metadata
- `tests/*`: 165 tests

## Suite Skills

- `paper-spine`: orchestrator
- `paper-spine-ui`: terminal configuration TUI
- `paper-spine-intake`: config collection
- `paper-spine-research`: target scene + exemplar learning (3-agent parallel)
- `paper-spine-citation`: citation support bank + quality audit
- `paper-spine-rewrite`: rewrite existing drafts
- `paper-spine-build`: build from materials
- `paper-spine-humanize`: AI detection reduction via tiered constraints
- `paper-spine-latex`: LaTeX/PDF/Word assembly
- `paper-spine-translate`: translation_zh/ package
- `paper-spine-audit`: integrity audit + structured review + artifact check
- `paper-spine-update`: check/update from GitHub

## Version

Canonical source: `dist/paperspine_version.json`.  Auto-propagated to
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` via
`sync_version_from_canonical()` in sync script.

## Development Rules

- Standard library only for Python scripts
- Keep dist copies synchronized across Claude/Codex/OpenClaw
- README.md (Chinese) and README.en.md (English) must stay content-equivalent
- Do not push to GitHub unless explicitly asked
- Run `python -m pytest tests` before claiming ready (expect 165 passed)
- Single source of truth: edit shared scripts in `src/scripts/`, references in
  `src/references/`, and each skill's `SKILL.md` in its **Claude** dist copy
  (`dist/claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`); `sync_local_installs.py --dist-only`
  fans these out to Codex/OpenClaw. Never hand-edit dist copies one by one.

## Sync Commands

```powershell
# Project-internal dist sync (fast, without install targets)
python src/scripts/sync_local_installs.py --dist-only

# Full sync to install directories
python src/scripts/sync_local_installs.py --clean-legacy
```
